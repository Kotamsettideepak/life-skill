- **Identify emotions** – Try to sense their mood: Are they upset, stressed, happy?
- **Reflect back** – In your own words, repeat what they said to confirm.
- **Mirror their tone** – Stay calm and respectful in your voice and body language.
- **Check understanding** – Say something like, “Did I get that right?”
