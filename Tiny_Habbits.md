The story about doing just 2 push-ups.

### Q2. What is B = MAP? How can it help?

- B means Behavior
- M means Motivation
- A means Ability
- P means Prompt

This formula shows how habits work.  
Motivation means how much you want to do it.  
Ability means how easy it is to do.  
Prompt means a reminder to start.  
So, if something is easy and you are reminded, you can do it even with low motivation.

### Q3. Why should we celebrate after doing a habit?

When we celebrate, we feel good.  
That good feeling tells the brain, “Do it again!”  
Even a small “yes!” or a fist bump helps  
Celebrating makes the habit stick faster and stronger

## 3. 1% Better Every Day

### Q4. What was the most interesting story or idea?

The example of getting 1% better every day.  
If you improve a little every day, the results add up.  
Like saving a small amount of money daily becomes a big amount.  
This idea helped me understand the power of daily effort.

So, start with small actions that match who you want to be.
