### Question 1  
Some points that were new to me:
- **Over-communicating even for small issues** like "no internet" or "laptop not working" – I usually don’t inform unless asked, but now I understand why it’s important.
- **Joining meetings early to bond with the team** – I never thought a few minutes could help build better rapport.
- **Using tools like Loom, CodeSandbox, or GitHub Gists** to explain issues – I mostly just ask questions in text, but now I see the benefit of being more visual and detailed.

### Question 2  
I need to improve in the **way I ask for help when I’m stuck**.  
Most times I just say “it’s not working” and wait for help. But now I realize I should:
- Clearly describe the issue  
- Mention what I already tried  
- Add screenshots or links to code  

To make progress, I will:
- Create a small checklist before asking questions  
- Start using GitHub Gist and Loom to make things more clear  
- Be more patient and respectful of others’ time when asking for help
