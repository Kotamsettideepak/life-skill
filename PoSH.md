# Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH)

## What is PoSH?

PoSH is short for Prevention of Sexual Harassment. It is the legislation enacted to safeguard women from sexual harassment within the workplace. In India, this act went into effect in 2013 and is properly titled the "Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013".

The primary objective of this legislation is to ensure each woman feels safe, respected, and protected while at work.

## Why is PoSH Important?

- It fosters a secure and conducive workplace.
- It prevents inappropriate behavior from occurring in the first place.
- It empowers women with the guts and a proper mechanism to voice what is incorrect.

## What is Considered Sexual Harassment?

Sexual harassment is not just about physical touch. It can involve a lot of acts, including:

- Inappropriate physical touch or advances
- Soliciting sexual favors
- Making sexual remarks or jokes
- Displaying sexual photos, messages, or videos
- Any move, glance, or gesture that makes a woman feel uncomfortable or unsafe

---

## Who is Protected?

- Any woman who works in an office — either permanent, temporary, intern, or visiting
- It covers all workplaces — government or private, organized or unorganized
- It even covers women working at home or remote sites

## What Should a Company Do?

All companies with 10+ employees **must** have an **Internal Committee (IC)**. The committee will deal with any complaint of sexual harassment.

### Internal Committee Must Have:

- A woman senior employee as the head
- At least two employees who are reliable and familiar with women's problems
- One outside person from the organization (such as from an NGO)

---

## How to Lodge a Complaint?

- A woman can submit a written complaint to the Internal Committee within **3 months** of the incident.
- The committee must start the inquiry within **7 days**.
- The whole process must be completed in **90 days**.

If the complaint is held valid, the company may take steps such as:

- Warning or suspension of the offending individual
- Salary deduction as compensation
- Police complaint (if grave)

## What if the Complaint is False?

If a person makes a false complaint **intentionally** and **with ill intention**, then action can be taken against them as well. But if a woman complains and it's merely not established, that's **not** a false complaint.

## Employer's Responsibilities

- Legibly post the company's anti-harassment policy
- Organize awareness programmes and training for all employees
- Assure the victim and ensure that she's not punished for raising her voice

## Final Words

All individuals have the right to be safe in the workplace. The PoSH Act is in place to ensure that women are protected and respected. Being aware of it and adhering to it with seriousness is all of our responsibilities — not merely HR or management.
