# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## 1 What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes **unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature** that can make someone feel uncomfortable, threatened, or discriminated against. Common examples include:

- Inappropriate touching or physical contact.
- Sharing sexually explicit content (messages, images, jokes).
- Repeated unwanted advances, flirting, or asking for dates.
- Making lewd comments, gestures, or innuendos.
- Staring or stalking in a way that makes the other person uncomfortable.
- Using position of power to demand sexual favors (quid pro quo).
- Passing derogatory or objectifying remarks based on gender or appearance.

Such behavior may happen in person, over calls, messages, emails, or online platforms—even outside the workplace—and still be considered workplace harassment if it affects professional life.

## 2 What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I **face or witness** any such behavior, I would:

1. **Stay calm and safe**: Remove myself or others from the situation if it's immediately threatening.
2. **Document the incident(s)**: Note date, time, place, people involved, and what happened.
3. **Report it immediately**:
   - To the **Internal Committee (IC)** if one exists in the organization.
   - Or to **HR/Manager** if unsure how to proceed.
4. **Support the victim** if I'm a witness:
   - Encourage them to speak up and accompany them if they choose to report.
5. **Cooperate during investigation**: If called upon, share factual observations.
6. **Avoid gossiping or judging**: Respect privacy and avoid spreading unverified details.
7. **Promote respectful conduct**: Be mindful of my own behavior and educate peers on boundaries.

> Every employee has the right to a safe, respectful, and inclusive work environment. Taking action against harassment is everyone's responsibility.
